# Exercise 4: Investigate and improve your process

In this exercise we'll learn how we can use SAP Signavio Process Intelligence drill into process details. We will mark spots for improvement with the built in **Insights** marker to collaboratively work and track process improvements. Last but not least we will check how to use the Process Explorer again to find available innovations that could resolve some of the process issues found.


## Exercise 4.1 Add a new behaviour based-investigation
For this exercise we suspect that there is some rework happening due to the fact that a Sales Order was not created properly in first place. So we will try to further dissect the data set to validate our hypothesis. 

1. To test our hypothesis we'll create a `New Chapter`

2. Name it `Automation Rate`

3. Add a new filter (on chapter level) based on `Behavior`

4. We first check that the `Create Sales Order` was initiating the process

5. And add a second `Behavior` filter that filters processes with rework

6. Add a `Breakdown` widget

7. And select type `metric` and select `Automation rate: Sales document creation`. Group by `BillToPartyCountry`

## Exercise 4.2 Mark a process insight and share with a colleague

1. We see that Colombia seems to have a reduced automation rate, compared to Canada and US. Click the `light bulb` to add an insight

2. Log a new insight, assign a Value Driver and select `Jennifer` as Assignee

With this we've given our colleague Jennifer a task to further investigate.


## Exercise 4.3 Check SAP Signavio Process Explorer for recommendations

1. Go back to the Process Collaboration Hub and navigate to process `Sell from Stock (5HL)`(or click [here](https://editor.signavio.com/p/hub/model/7148c645c5b3433f9a3482c81372a00b)). Ensure that the overlay `AI Technologies` is active.

2. Find the `Create Sales Order` activity and find one an available automation `5LT Automatic Creation of Sales Order from Unstructured Data`. 
<br>![](images/4_011.png)

3. Click the link to follow to find further information about the available automation

You can now contact the colleagues in *Columbia* to check if they would benefit from automating their Sales Order creation process! As soon as they've activated the capability you can see improvements in a trend analysis in SAP Signavio Process Intelligence.
